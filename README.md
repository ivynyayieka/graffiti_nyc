# NYC parks are battling graffiti vandals after the pandemic
For this project, I analysed data related to graffiti in NYC and 

# Getting the data

I used two major sets of data
* [311 complaints about graffiti](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data)
* [City Government Daily Tasks](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Daily-Tasks-Park-Cleaning-Records/kwte-dppd/data)

I also pulled viewership numbers from the [wikihow page on viewing graffiti at Riverside Park](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-to-the-Freedom-Tunnel).

### How I analysed graffiti complaints bounce back in 2022 after pandemic's peak in NYC at more than double the complaints in 2021

I pulled all graffiti-related complaints from 311 data, then grouped the data by location and year. I also looked at the addresses appearing most frequently.

### How I made the analysis on graffiti cleaning is taking up more park workers' times with a 40% increase in the last full year

I pulled data on daily NYC government tasks and filtered all where graffiti was involved.
